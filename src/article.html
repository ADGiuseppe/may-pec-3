        <section>
          <p>
            Ever wondered where your old phone or empty shampoo bottle ends up? In a circular economy, the answer isn't “the landfill”—it's back into use. 
          </p>
          <p>
            A circular economy is a system where products and materials are kept in circulation for as long as possible. Instead of the “take-make-waste” pattern of the traditional linear economy, the circular model is all about reduce, reuse, recycle—over and over again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through better design, smarter use of materials, and a commitment to sustainability, the circular economy aims to turn waste into a resource, extending the life of everything from packaging to electronics.

              Let’s face it—our current way of living is putting the planet under pressure. The Earth’s resources aren’t unlimited, and we're using them faster than they can regenerate. The circular economy tackles that by protecting natural ecosystems, cutting emissions, and reducing dependence on raw materials. For example, more than 80% of a product’s environmental impact is locked in during the design stage. So, if we design smarter, we pollute less.

        <h2 class="article-title mb-6">What Are the Economic and Social Benefits of Going Circular?</h2>
        <section>
          <p>
            Think the circular economy is just an environmental trend? Think again—it’s also smart economics. By using resources more efficiently, companies can cut costs, reduce reliance on volatile global supply chains, and unlock new business opportunities. The European Union estimates that the shift to a circular economy could generate 700,000 new jobs by 2030.
          </p>
          <p>
            Social benefits also often get overlooked; waste doesn’t affect everyone equally. Landfills and polluting industries are often located near low-income and marginalized communities, exposing them to greater health risks. The circular economy has the potential to change that narrative by reducing pollution at the source and promoting cleaner, safer jobs through green innovation. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) refers to it as building a “circular economy for all.”
